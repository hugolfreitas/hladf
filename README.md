👋 Hi, I’m Hugo Ladeira de Freitas, working as Senior Front end engineer, with more than 8 years of knowledge in development and other related stuffs. 

I’m interested in Front end technologies (as React, Nextjs, vuejs, redux...), solutions, UX and new ways to solve problems. 
Most of my repositories here are deprecated or too old, sorry.
